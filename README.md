**Previous Experience:**  
<hl/>
- I have been intrested in programming from a long time. I have been making small projects (mainly in Python) over the last few years. I am in the process of learning machine learning.
- I had been introduced to the ROS system in the starting of an Anveshak mini-project. I had initially joined the mini project to get exposure, but didn't want to dedicate time to something i wasn't intrested in the future (Anveshak Rover).
- I have also participated in an IRO and FLL.  
- Though not directly related, I was one of the major contributor to Cauvery's Micro-Mouse attempt.


**Current PORs:**  
<hl/>
- None.

**Why I want to work in the team:**  
<hl/>
I've always been intrested in self driving vehicles ever since I had seen the earlier attempts by Google and Apple.  
I had heard that Abhiyaan is working on a self driving shuttle for insti, and that is something that I hope I can help make a reality.

**Relevant Courses:**  
<hl/>
_In Insti:_
- MM2090: Introduction to scientific computing.

_Online:_
- PadhAI: DL#101-108 Completed. Further courses in progress.

 I wasn't able to make JAUS++ part of the application work at all.
